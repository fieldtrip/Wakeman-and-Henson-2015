# PracticalMEEG - Paris 2019

PracticalMEEG aims at providing an intensive severalâ€“days training to MEG and EEG
analysts. It will provide its attendees with the ability to create a full analysis
pipeline with exemplar (or their own) data in one or several of three leading software
dedicated to MEG and EEG analysis (Brainstorm, FieldTrip and MNE-python). On demand, we
hope to provide attendees with the opportunity to bridge across toolboxes and weave their
own complex multi-software pipeline.

The dataset used during the PracticalMEEG hands-on sessions is part of a dataset recorded
by Rik Hanson and colleagues. We will mainly work with the MEG data of a single
representative subject; for the group statistics we will work with source-level processed
data from all subjects.
